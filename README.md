# Why I Did This Project?

1. To have a practical experience on how to **integrate RESTful APIs with Angular**
2. To learn **data visualization with D3.js**

# Challenges

1. Retrieving & using the weather data
2. Drawing chart with D3.js

# Development Process

1. Planning: Searching the right API & chosing OpenWeatherMap API. Selecting to show only the temparature
2. Integrating the API: Created Angular Service & Implemented HTTPClient Module
3. Drawing the chart with D3.js: Hardest & longest
4. Integrating the weather data with the chart:

# My Top Takeaways

1. Angular & RESTful API
2. D3.js

# Future Scope
